<h3>Homer consulting is a firm that is looking for the set up of a completely new Database based on Oracle 11g. They also have some complex SQL questions that they need help building queries for. The ER diagram they want to implement is as below. I created tables with the necessary contraints such as appropriate primary keys, foriegn keys and several other contraints that check dates, uniques etc.</h3>
